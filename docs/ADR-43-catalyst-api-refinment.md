# Catalyst API and Protocol refinement 

## Context

The [Catalyst API](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/) has been evolving and adding different functionalities, endpoints and parameters as needed by the evolving platform requirements. Because of this needs, some changes while good decissions at the moment to unblock features, were not thought hollistically or now they may be causing too much unneded Data Transfer cost or have room for perfomance improvement for the Catalysts core processes like Bootstrapping and Synchronization. 

## Decision

After reviewing the Catalyst API we defined a set of changes to clean up and close a first version of the Catalyst Protocol. The changes that will be described below will enable us to: 
- Reduce Data Transfer cost by only narrow down the response bodies to only return the needed information
- Reduce public API complexity by hiding endpoints that are only inteended for troubleshooting, this will also reduce hits to endpoints that should not be used externally
- Improve the Catalyst bootstrapping and synchronization time by reducing the amount of request and information recieved for the synchronization 
- Do a more efficient use of the DB
- Open the door to create new Catalyst implementation based on this protocol definition

List of API changes:

Deprecated endpoints won't be part of the Catalyst Protocol definition but we may keep some of them as internal troubleshooting tools, these endpoints will require a key in order to be used. 
Those endpoints that will be removed from the Protocol but remain available for internal use, have the `SECURE` tag in the change description. 

Endpoints not mentioned in the following list will not suffer any change. 

| Endpoint                                                         | Deprecate YES/NO | Change Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This endpoint also has a complex UX with the application of many filters and a lot of parameters. We are going to tag this as TROUBLESHOOTING and add 2 new endpoints: one to retrieve the list of all pointers and another to retrieve the history of a given list of pointers. Catalyst synchronization will be done using `/snapshots` and `/pointer-changes`. |

# Status

Rejected by DAO 

# Consequences

`/deployments`: We are not aware if this endpoint is being used for anything else besides the Catalyst synchronization and bootstrapping processes. 

The `fetchAllDeployments` method from the [Catalyst Client](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst-client) will only be available to be used by the Catalyst Servers in order to sync all the Content Service history. 

The rest of the changes should not cause any impact on the Catalyst clients
