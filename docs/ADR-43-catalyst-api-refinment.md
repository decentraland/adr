# Catalyst API and Protocol refinement 

## Context

The [Catalyst API](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/) has been evolving and adding different functionalities, endpoints and parameters as needed by the evolving platform requirements. Because of this needs, some changes while good decissions at the moment to unblock features, were not thought hollistically or now they may be causing too much unneded Data Transfer cost or have room for perfomance improvement for the Catalysts core processes like Bootstrapping and Synchronization. 

## Decision

After reviewing the Catalyst API we defined a set of changes to clean up and close a first version of the Catalyst Protocol. The changes that will be described below will enable us to: 
- Reduce Data Transfer cost by only narrow down the response bodies to only return the needed information
- Reduce public API complexity by hiding endpoints that are only inteended for troubleshooting, this will also reduce hits to endpoints that should not be used externally
- Improve the Catalyst bootstrapping and synchronization time by reducing the amount of request and information recieved for the synchronization 
- Do a more efficient use of the DB
- Open the door to create new Catalyst implementation based on this protocol definition

List of API changes: 

| Endpoint                                                       | Deprecate YES/NO | Change Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This endpoint also has a complex UX with the application of many filters and a lot of parameters. The proposal is to deprecate (or request an API key to be used for troubleshooting) this and add 2 new endpoints: one to retrieve the list of all pointers and another to retrieve the history of a given list of pointers. Catalyst synchronization will be done using `/snapshots` and `/pointer-changes`.   |

# Status

Under Review

# Consequences

`/deployments`: We are not aware if this endpoint is being used for anything else besides the Calatys synchronization and bootstraping processes. 

The rest of the changes should not cause any impact on the Catalyst clients
