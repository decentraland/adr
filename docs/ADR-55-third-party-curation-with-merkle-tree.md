# Third Party Curation With Merkle Tree

## Statement of the problem

Third parties may want to add one item representation per NFT. Each item may need to be accepted by the Decentraland catalysts. For third parties with an small number of items, the current flow of the Decentraland collection where each items is submitted and curated by using the blockchain works but for projects with > 500 nfts (item representations) it does not scale. Having in mind the gas limit of each transaction, we can submit batches of 40-50 items. The third party manager and the curator will need to submit around 250 transactions each for a collection of 10k items. We need to find a way to optimize the managers and curators time while keeping the process trustless and with a good UX.

## Proposed solution

### Item creation

### Item curation

### Item upload
