# Documentation as a priority

## Context and Problem Statement

* How do I start the explorer in my machine?
* Why do the scenes run in a WebWorker?
* Where are the builder resources stored?
* What are the main repositories?
* How can I add a feature to the SDK?

Those are common questions that are raised by both experienced contributor or newcomers to the project. 

We are searching for alignment for an approach towards a more sustainable future where people can search and find those answers without depending on specific individuals.



## Considered Options

* Start a cultural shift towards documentation as a priority
* Continue as we are, only creating documentation as a proactive initiative of certain individuals

## Decision Outcome

We choose to _start a cultural shift towards documentation as a priority_ because:
* We want to accept more contributions to the project
* Our source code is public, but it has proven to be very complex to understand without help
* Onboarding new people to the project is very difficult and almost always requires a mentor

#### Actionables
* Start communicating to the teams this initiative
* Try to slowly start documenting new features or architectural changes
* Create a gitbook where we can add documentation in a bureaucracy-free fashion. We spoke about playbooks like: `How to clone and start the Decentraland client`
* Evaluate if we can start documenting what we currently have retroactively, no need to rush.
