# Entities V4

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to ensure entities once deployed are always valid and every client knows how to read information. For the time being, entities can be deployed with any information as metadata, which can lead to several issues when something is missing or contains invalid data.

## Decisions

We defined a list of changes to support the new validations

- [Entity schemas][1] will be defined for all entity types and every deployment will be validated against them.
- As there will be a transition period in the content server, when getting the deployments through lambdas we will need to transform any entity into a compliant format. Most probably that this change will only be needed for wearables names and descriptions.
- Deployment size will be validated per pointer taking into account previous deployments and the final result and not just the current deployment files. This will prevent land owners to exceed the size limits as it happens today.
- Wearables size will be validated without taking into account the generated images (thumbnail and image with rarity background) and a new size limit will be set:
  - Total size: 3MB
  - All files size without generated images: 2MB
- A deadline will be defined for the new validations to start working.
- Every active repository in the decentraland github organization where entities types are defined to use [common-schemas][1].

## Deadline

    ADR45_DEADLINE: 2022-05-03T14:00:00Z
    Unix Timestamp: 1651586400

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

Entities that don't pass the validations will be rejected after the deadline.
Landowners will face new size limits on their parcels. If someone actually exceeds the max size limit and wants to change something on their scene, then they will have to remove files until they respect the new limit size.
