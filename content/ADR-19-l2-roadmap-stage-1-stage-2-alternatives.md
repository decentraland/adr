## Objetive

Define the best strategy to have collections v2 in a l2 lowering the risk and time to market while increasing the value for users.

## Alt A: Collections v2 In-world Primary sales & Marketplace Secondary Sales: Divided UI

### Stage 1 ðŸ”¶

- Users will be able to create collections v2 by paying X MANA by using the builder.

- Users will be able to perform primary sales of collections v2 items in-world (Explorer)

- Users will be able to perform secondary sales of collections v2 items in the marketplace. **These items will appear in a different section than the L1 items (UI).**

- Users will be able to deposit MANA from L1 to L2 by using the marketplace.

- Committee members will be able to approve/reject collections by using the builder

```x-dot
digraph {
    rankdir=LR
    graph [fontname = "arial", fontsize="10", color="grey", fontcolor="grey"]
    node [fontname = "arial",fontsize="10", shape="box", style="rounded"]
    edge [fontname = "arial",color="blue", fontcolor="black",fontsize="10"]

    users -> explorer[color=orange, fontcolor=orange,  label="Perform primary sales"]
    users -> marketplace[color=orange, fontcolor=orange,  label="Perform secondary sales"]
    explorer -> collections [color=orange, fontcolor=orange]
    marketplace -> collections [color=orange, fontcolor=orange]
    creators -> collections[color=orange, fontcolor=orange  label="create"]
    commiteee -> collections[color=orange, fontcolor=orange,  label="approve/reject"]

    edge[ style = invis ]
    users -> { explorer marketplace }
}
```

### Stage 2 ðŸ”·

- Users will be able to create/manage stores for collections v2 by using the builder.

- Users will be able to perform primary sales of collections v2 items in the marketplace. **These items will appear along with the L1 items (UI).**

- Users will be able to filter by stores in the marketplace.

- Users will be able to perform bids of collections v2 items in the marketplace.

```x-dot
digraph {
    rankdir=LR
    graph [fontname = "arial", fontsize="10", color="grey", fontcolor="grey"]

## Decision outcome

### Alt A

#### Pros

- Lower time to market: As long as we can use the current marketplace design with a fewer changes, this alternative has less work for the Dapps team.

- Users are used to performing primary sales in-world (previous license events).

#### Cons

- The content team should create a scene/tutorial about how to perform primary sales of collection v2 items.

### Alt B âœ…

#### Pros

- Users are used to performing in-world primary sales (previous license events).

#### Cons

- Dapps we will need to create a server to connect different sources (subgraphs) to display items from different layers altogether. This server will take ~4 weeks and it has dependencies hard to control and/or estimate. E.g: Thegraph does not support Matic testnet (Mumbai) and we need to host a node graph running it.

- The content team should create a scene/tutorial about how to perform primary sales of collection v2 items.

### Alt C

#### Pros

- No big dependencies from other teams rather than the dApps team.

#### Cons

- High effort and a long time to market.
