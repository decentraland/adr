## Context and Problem Statement

- How do I start the explorer in my machine?
- Why do the scenes run in a WebWorker?
- Where are the builder resources stored?
- What are the main repositories?
- How can I add a feature to the SDK?

Those are common questions that are raised by both experienced contributor or newcomers to the project.

We are searching for alignment for an approach towards a more sustainable future where people can search and find those answers without depending on specific individuals.

## Considered Options

- Start a cultural shift towards documentation as a priority
- Continue as we are, only creating documentation as a proactive initiative of certain individuals

## Decision Outcome

We choose to _start a cultural shift towards documentation as a priority_ because:

- We want to accept more contributions to the project
- Our source code is public, but it has proven to be very complex to understand without help
- Onboarding new people to the project is very difficult and almost always requires a mentor

#### Actionables

- Start communicating to the teams this initiative
- Try to slowly start documenting new features or architectural changes
- Create a gitbook where we can add documentation in a bureaucracy-free fashion. We spoke about playbooks like: `How to clone and start the Decentraland client`
- Evaluate if we can start documenting what we currently have retroactively, no need to rush.
