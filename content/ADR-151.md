## Abstract

This document describes the requirements to render the UI entities for the Decentraland Protocol. TL;DR; Pre-order using the entity tree defined by the UiTransform ([ADR-124](/adr/ADR-124)).

## Specification

The UI entities are derived from a synthetic tree of entities defined by the UiTransformComponent ([ADR-124](/adr/ADR-124)). That tree should be rendered from the root to the leafs recursively using a pre-order sequencing.

That means the children will overwrite the pixels of the parent. This is a common practice, HTML, ReactNative and Unity's UiToolkit behave this way out of the box.

It MUST be possible to configure entities to act as stencil to only render what it is between the borders of the parent entity. The default behavior MUST be that children will be rendered in ful (without stencil) even though are bigger than the borders of the parent. The stencil is an analogous to the `overflow: hidden` CSS property.
