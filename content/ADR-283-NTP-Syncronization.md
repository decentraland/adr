# ADR-283: Time Synchronization

## Abstract

This document describes a time synchronization mechanism for the Decentraland Unity client that provides a unified source of synchronized time across all clients. By implementing Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization and introducing the `PBSyncedClock` component, this ADR establishes a foundation for any time-dependent feature in Decentraland that requires coordination across multiple clients. The initial implementation enhances `PBTween` with synchronized timestamps, but the system is designed to support animations, video players, sounds, and other time-sensitive features.

## Context, Reach & Prioritization

The Decentraland platform lacks a unified time synchronization mechanism, which affects multiple systems that rely on coordinated timing across clients:

- **Tweens and Moving Objects**: Platforms, elevators, and doors appear in different positions for different users
- **Animations**: Character animations and visual effects start at different times, breaking immersion
- **Video Players**: Synchronized video playback for shared viewing experiences is impossible
- **Audio**: Background music and sound effects cannot be synchronized across users
- **Timed Events**: Scheduled events or time-based game mechanics lack coordination

Currently, all these systems rely on local client time, which leads to:
- **Drift between clients**: Each client's local clock differs, causing desynchronization
- **Broken experiences**: From gameplay issues (falling through platfloorms) to aesthetic problems (unsynchronized dance animations)
- **Limited creative possibilities**: Creators cannot build experiences that require precise timing coordination

This limitation affects:
- **Scene creators**: Who need synchronized time for games, events, and multimedia experiences
- **End users**: Who experience inconsistent gameplay and broken immersion
- **Platform capabilities**: Limiting the sophistication of experiences that can be built

The prioritization of this feature is driven by:
1. **Foundational requirement**: Time synchronization is a prerequisite for many advanced features
2. **Multiple use cases**: One implementation benefits tweens, animations, video, and audio
3. **Community demand**: Creators consistently request better synchronization capabilities

## Solution Space Exploration

### Option 1: Server-Sent Timestamps (Rejected)
Relying solely on timestamps sent by the realm server was considered but rejected because:
- Less robust than standard time synchronization protocols
- Potentially less accurate due to variable network latency
- Wouldn't work in scenarios where the client is not connected to a realm

### Option 2: Local Time Only (Current State - Rejected)
Continuing with the current system of local client time was rejected as it prevents any form of synchronized experience.

### Option 3: NTP-Based Synchronization (Selected)
Implement client-side NTP synchronization with reliable time servers. This approach:
- Uses an industry-standard protocol designed for distributed time synchronization
- Provides microsecond-level accuracy when properly implemented
- Serves as a foundation for all time-dependent systems
- Gracefully handles network issues with fallback mechanisms

## Specification

### Protocol Changes

#### New Component: PBSyncedClock
A new Protocol Buffers component will be added at `proto/decentraland/sdk/components/synced_clock.proto`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package decentraland.sdk.components;

import "decentraland/sdk/components/common/id.proto";
option (common.ecs_component_id) = 1099;

// PBSyncedClock provides synchronized time information based on NTP server data
// This component can be used to maintain consistent time across all clients
message PBSyncedClock {
  // The current synchronized time (in milliseconds since epoch)
  uint64 synced_timestamp = 1;

  // The synchronization status
  SyncStatus status = 7;
}

// Status of time synchronization
enum SyncStatus {
  // The component is not yet synchronized with the NTP server
  SS_UNINITIALIZED = 0;

  // The component is currently attempting to synchronize with the NTP server
  SS_SYNCHRONIZING = 1;

  // The component is successfully synchronized with the NTP server
  SS_SYNCHRONIZED = 2;

  // The component failed to synchronize with the NTP server
  SS_ERROR = 3;
}
```

#### Enhanced PBTween Component
The existing `PBTween` component will be modified to include:
```protobuf
message PBTween {
  // ... existing fields ...
  optional uint64 start_synced_timestamp = 9; // timestamp (in milliseconds) when the tween started, allows synchronization across clients
}
```

### Implementation Details

#### Phase 1: NTP Time Synchronization
1. **Time Synchronization Client**
   - Connect to reliable NTP servers (e.g., `time.google.com`, `pool.ntp.org`)
   - Alternatively, use a Decentraland-hosted time service
   - Implement standard NTP offset calculation:
     - Round-trip delay: `(T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)`
     - Clock offset: `((T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4)) / 2`

2. **Synchronization Process**
   - Synchronize on client startup
   - Re-synchronize periodically (every 60 seconds)
   - Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts

#### Phase 2: SyncedClock System
1. **TimeComponentSystem**
   - Create singleton entity with `PBSyncedClock` component
   - Update `synced_timestamp` on every engine tick
   - Manage synchronization status transitions
   - Provide API for other systems to query synchronized time

2. **Error Handling**
   - Fallback to local time when synchronization fails
   - Log synchronization errors for debugging
   - Implement recovery mechanisms

#### Phase 3: System Integration
1. **Tween System (Initial Implementation)**
   - `createTweenSyncSystem` (introduced in [js-sdk-toolchain PR #1121](https://github.com/decentraland/js-sdk-toolchain/pull/1121)) automatically injects `start_synced_timestamp` for every `PBTween` when a synchronized clock is available, so content-creators do **not** need to set this field manually.
   - For tweens created **before** the clock is synchronized, the system back-fills the correct `start_synced_timestamp` once the clock becomes available, preserving the original offset.
   - Tweens are processed only when the `SyncedClock` status is `SS_SYNCHRONIZED` and when network initialization is complete, preventing visual glitches during the bootstrap phase.
   - Backward tweens and restart sequences are handled correctlyâ€”when a tween restarts, the system resets the sync timestamp to ensure deterministic playback across clients.
   - Maintains full backward compatibility: scenes authored with older SDK versions continue to work, simply running on local time if synchronization is disabled or unavailable.

2. **Future Integrations**
   - **Animation System**: Use synchronized time for animation start times
   - **Video Player**: Synchronize video playback position across clients
   - **Audio System**: Coordinate background music and sound effects
   - **Event System**: Schedule and trigger events at precise synchronized times

### Use Cases

#### Immediate (Tweens)
1. **Moving Platforms**: Consistent position across all players
2. **Elevators**: Synchronized arrival/departure times
3. **Rotating Objects**: Identical rotation state for all users
4. **Doors and Gates**: Open/close at the same moment

#### Future Possibilities
1. **Synchronized Animations**: Dance performances, cutscenes, visual effects
2. **Shared Video Experiences**: Watch parties, presentations, tutorials
3. **Musical Experiences**: Synchronized background music, rhythm games
4. **Timed Events**: Countdowns, scheduled activities, time-based puzzles

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing systems continue to work with local time if not updated
- `PBTween` without `start_synced_timestamp` behaves as before
- Gradual adoption allows systems to migrate when ready

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Unified Time Source**: Single source of truth for all time-dependent systems
- **Extensible Foundation**: Easy to add synchronization to new features
- **Improved User Experience**: Consistent behavior across all clients
- **New Creative Possibilities**: Enables sophisticated synchronized experiences

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: Adds NTP synchronization logic to the client
- **External Dependencies**: Relies on NTP servers or dedicated infrastructure
- **Initial Sync Delay**: Brief period at startup where time may not be synchronized

## Security Considerations
- NTP servers must be trusted sources

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal overhead: NTP synchronization happens infrequently (every 60 seconds)
- `PBSyncedClock` update is lightweight (single timestamp update per frame)
- Systems opt-in to synchronized time only when needed

## Open Questions
1. Should Decentraland host its own NTP servers or rely on public infrastructure?
