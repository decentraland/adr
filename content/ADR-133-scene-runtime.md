# Abstract

This ADR describes the outline of the "scene runtime" for Decentraland, it includes a minimum set of required environment functions to run a scene, including the formalization of the RPC protocol to load other parts i.e. the Rendering engine (Renderer from now on).

## What is a scene?

Decentraland Explorers (defined in [ADR-102](/adr/ADR-102) are often compared with operative systems that run programs. **A scene is a deployable JavaScript program** that controls a set of entities in-world, the user-interface, and also may add functionality to the Explorer. Those programs run in a sandboxed environment exposing a set of functions to enable the scene to communicate with other components like the Rendering engine.

### Loading scenes

The deployed scenes MUST comply with the Scene schema defined in [ADR-51](/adr/ADR-51). And the format used to represent the deployment is the one used in the content servers as defined in [ADR-80](/adr/ADR-80). Entities can be loaded as scenes if their metadata matches the `scene.json` schema. For the sake of simplicity in this specification, we are assuming a minimum `scene.json` in the shape of `{"main": "bin/scene.js"}` to illustrate how to load and run the code.

1. First the information of the entity is fetched, it includes the list of deployed files. Based on the entity information, the renderer and runtime will know how to resolve assets.
2. Then the runtime will create an isolated runtime environment for the program of the scene.
3. The runtime will use the entity information to fetch the code from `bin/scene.js` and run it. The mechanism to resolve files based on deployed entities is explained in detail in [ADR-79](/adr/ADR-79).
4. After that first eval, the scene may load the entities from the EngineAPI module, and it will start a main loop tight after.

### Program states & lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [*] --> CreateRuntime(Entity)

    CreateRuntime(Entity) --> FetchCode(Entity)

    RequireModules --> Eval(code)
    GetInitialState --> .OnStart()

    state RuntimeSandbox {
      FetchCode(Entity) --> Eval(code)

    .OnStart()
    Eval(code) --> .OnStart()

      .OnStart() --> .OnUpdate(dt)


      state MainLoop {
        .OnUpdate(dt) --> .OnUpdate(dt)
      }
    }

    .OnUpdate(dt) --> [*]
```

### Exposed functions and objects

The runtime for the SDK7 is compatible with [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS)'s `require` to load RPC modules. This is so to enable a wide variety of bundlers to create compatible Decentraland scenes.

The exposed RPC modules are defined in the [protocol repository](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/main/proto/decentraland/kernel/apis/engine_api.proto).

> TODO: define and document naming conventions about code generation for modules

```ts
// `require` instantiates a proxy to a RPC module. Every exposed function
// of the module returns a promise.
// require must fail immediately if the moduleName is invalid or unknown,
// and it must return a Module or Proxy synchronously
function require(moduleName: string): Module

// Commonjs-compatible modules
const exports: Object
const module: {
  readonly exports: typeof exports
}

// extra functions
function fetch(requestInit: Request): Promise<Response>
function fetch(url: string, requestInit: Request): Promise<Response>

class WebSocket {}

function setImmediate(fn: Function): void
```

> TODO: Document fetch and WebSocket adaptations for Decentraland Scenes

### Synchronizing scene's entities with the renderer

The scenes synchronize with the renderer via the `EngineApi.crdtSendToRenderer` RPC using the CRDT protocol defined in [ADR-117](/adr/ADR-117). The renderer will keep a local copy of all the entities and components required for rendering. Those components are in their majority serialized using protobuf as defined in [ADR-123](/adr/ADR-123).

The `EngineApi.crdtSendToRenderer` response includes a list of CRDT messages to be applied in the local scene, that is used to send information back from the renderer like the position of the player.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant S as Scene
  participant K as Runtime
  participant R as Renderer

  S->>S: Load the code of the scene and execute it

  S->>K: require("~system/EngineApi")
  activate K
  K-->>R: Create scene ID=1
  K-->>S: EngineApi
  deactivate K

  loop function onUpdate(deltaTime: number)
    S-->>S: engine.update(deltaTime)
    S->>R: crdtSendToRenderer(stateChanges)
    activate R
    R-->>R: Apply patches to the engine owned entities
    R-->>R: Execute queries
    R-->>S: CRDT changes (if any)
    deactivate R
    S-->>S: Apply patches to the scene owned entities
  end
```

### Runtime event handlers

The scene can hook up to certain events by adding functions to the `module.exports` variable. The functions that can be registered are:

- `onStart(): Promise<void> | void` is the first function to be called in a scene. It is recommended that all side-effects related to the initialization of a scene are performed inside the `onStart` function.
- `onUpdate(deltaTime: number): Promise<void> | void` is called every frame. It is in charge of the scene itself to run the frame and send/receive changes to the renderer

```ts
// The following example only illustrates an hypothetic scenario,
// since it is a low-level API and it shouldn't be used this way
let rotation = 0
export async function onUpdate(deltaTimeSeconds: number) {
  const speed = 0.001
  rotation += deltaTimeSeconds * speed
  updateEntityRotation(rotation)
  await sendUpdatesToRenderer()
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ Since the runtime is compatible with [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS), the event handler functions can be exported as `export function ...` and skip the `module.exports = ...` for convenience.

#### Pseudocode example of a scene

```typescript
const engineApi = require("~system/EngineApi")

// this is a lamport timestamp, required by the CRDT rules
let timestamp = 0

const position = Vector3.Zero()
const scale = Vector3.One()
const rotation = Quaternion.Identity()

// entities are now numbers
const entityId = 1234

// component numbers, defined in .proto files
const transformId = 1
const rendererMeshId = 2

const transform = Transform.serialize({ position, rotation, scale })
const mesh = RendererMesh.serialize({ box: {} })

// now we are sending the component messages from the LWW-ElementSet
// this sets the transform & meshRenderer for the entity
const messagesBackFromRenderer = await engineApi.crdtSendToRenderer([
  CRDT.PutMessage(entityId, transformId, transform, timestamp++),
  CRDT.PutMessage(entityId, rendererMeshId, mesh, timestamp++),
])

module.exports.onUpdate = function(deltaTime: number) {
  const transformId = 1
  position.x += deltaTime
  const transform = Transform.serialize({ position, rotation, scale })

  // now we are sending the component messages from the LWW-ElementSet
  // this sets the transform & meshRenderer for the entity
  const messagesBackFromRenderer = await engineApi.crdtSendToRenderer([
    CRDT.PutMessage(entityId, transformId, transform, timestamp++),
  ])
}
```
