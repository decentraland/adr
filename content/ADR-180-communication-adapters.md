## Abstract

<!--
Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the document section. **Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this document is about in its current state.** Abstracts should be always up to date with the current state of the document.
-->

This document lists and describes the official communication protocols available for [realms (ADR-110)](/adr/ADR-110). This document should be updated regularly when the implementations change or are added to the explorers.

## Glossary

- **Communications transport** underlying technology and/or underlying transport protocol in which the Decentraland explorers implement an adapter
- **Communications adapter** piece of code or object that connects the internal state of the explorer with a specific transport
- **Realm** [set of configurations](/adr/ADR-110) for an [explorer](/adr/ADR-102)

## Solution Space Exploration

Decentraland explorers connect to different communications transports via connection strings, URL-like identifiers containing all the information needed to select the technology and establish the connection to the target network.

The basic structure of a connection string is defined with the following BNF:

```bnf
PROTOCOL          := !':' [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9-]+
PARAMETERS        := any+
CONNECTION_STRING := PROTOCOL ':' PARAMETERS
```

Here are some examples:

```
ws-room:ws-room-service.decentraland.org/rooms/123-room-id
^^^^^^^                                                    protocol
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ parameter

offline:offline
^^^^^^^         protocol
        ^^^^^^^ parameter

livekit:wss://livekit.decentral.io?access_token=abc1223123
^^^^^^^                                                    protocol
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ parameter

```

## Specification

The realms will provide ways to get a connection string for our session. A communications adapter must be created with that connection string, which will use a communications transport under the hood.

All communications adapters must implement the semantics defined in [ADR-104](/adr/ADR-104). Some adapters, like livekit, may take advantage of their underlying implementations to set up Voice chat.

> TODO: Document the voicechat semantics

### Resolution of communications transport

1. Get the connection string
1. Parse it and separate the components protocol and params `[protocol, params] = str.split(':', max: 2)`
1. Find the function that handles the `protocol` and call it with the `params`

### Protocols

Here is the list of officially supported protocols

- `offline` will create an empty adapter. This protocol is used to test without communications servers and by some single-player experiences like the onboarding tutorial. The parameters for the offline protocol are implementation dependent.
- `simulator` will create different simulation conditions to evaluate performance and use cases. The parameters for the simulator protocol are implementation dependent.
- `ws-room` will create a WebSocket transport, using the wire protocol and semantics defined in [ADR-105](/adr/ADR-105). The parameter is the absolute URL to be connected to, including the hostname. If no protocol is defined in the URL, `wss://` will be prepended.
- `livekit` will create a LiveKit transport. The parameter is the absolute URL to be connected to, including the hostname and the livekit token if needed. It is mandatory to specify the `wss://` protocol as part of the URL.
- `signed-login` performs a signed-fetch as defined in [ADR-44](/adr/ADR-44). It is used to authenticate the user BEFORE sending the final connection string. The connection string comes as part of the response in the `fixedAdapter` JSON field. In case of an error or denied access, a `message` can be sent to the user to provide more information about the reason for the denial.

#### `signed-login` verifications

The signed login exists as part of a "handshake" mechanism to enable authenticated log-ins and access control to different communication services like Livekit.

The verifications of the [signed fetch](/adr/ADR-44) must look for the following properties: `intent`, `signer`, and `isGuest`.

```typescript
// connectionString = "signed-login:https://my-server/authenticate-comms"

import { Request } from "express"
import * as dcl from "decentraland-crypto-middleware"

app.post("/authenticate-comms", dcl.express(), (req: Request & dcl.DecentralandSignatureData, res) => {
  const address: string = req.auth
  const metadata: Record<string, any> = req.authMetadata
  const isGuest: boolean = req.authMetadata.isGuest

  if (!validateMetadata(req.authMetadata)) {
    res.json({ message: "Access denied, invalid metadata" })
    return
  }

  if (!validateAddressHasAccess(address, isGuest)) {
    res.json({ message: "Access denied" })
    return
  }

  // if this point is reached, we can generate a safe token for the address
  res.json({ fixedAdapter: getAdapterFor(address) })
})

function validateMetadata(metadata: Record<string, any>) {
  if (metadata.signer !== "dcl:explorer" || metadata.intent !== "dcl:explorer:comms-handshake") {
    // this validation prevents signedFetch from the SDK to be used
    // to authenticate users into comms
    return false
  }
  return true
}
```

Implementations of `signed-login` SHOULD add more safety mechanisms like HMAC-signed tokens to their URLs to prevent fraudulent logins.
