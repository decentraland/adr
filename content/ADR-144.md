## Abstract

<!--
Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the document section. **Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this document is about in its current state.** Abstracts should be always up to date with the current state of the document.
-->

This document describes the Realm resolution algorithms to consistently resolve servers based on a realm connection string. It resembles DNS, and uses the DAO catalysts, ENS and URLs to resolve the realms as described in [ADR-110](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-110).

Realms ([ADR-110](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-110)) are the configurations that define what and how is executed and rendered in a Decentraland Explorer ([ADR-102](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-102)). If we reason by analogy and consider an Explorer like a Web Browser, and the Scenes like WebSites. Then the Realm is the URL of that site.

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.
-->

Realms are represented as strings. Those strings need to be resolved to a base URL of a valid realm, which then will be used to calculate `baseUrl+'/about'` to comply with the realm specification.

The mechanism to resolve that endpoint is:
1. If the string is an URL, then it use the URL
1. If the string is an ENS, then 
   1. If there is a `dcl.realm` TXT record in the ENS, return that value
   1. Otherwise, if it is a `.dcl.eth` subdomain, then it falls back to the Worlds resolver
1. If the string equals to the name of a DAO catalyst, then it picks the URL of the Catalyst like `https://peer.decentraland.org` using the DAO catalyst resolver.
1. If this point is reached, then the realm is invalid.

### ENS resolver

NAME and ENS holders can decide where their worlds are hosted. For that purpose, a special record `dcl.realm` can be added both to ENS and NAME tokens and it should resolve to a base URL that is compliant with the [Realm specification (ADR-110)](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-110)

### Worlds resolver

Worlds is a configuration of services that enable deploying Decentraland scenes using a NAME, as described in [ADR-111](/adr/ADR-111). To resolve Worlds, an URL in the shape of `https://worlds-content-server.decentraland.org/world/<NAME>.dcl.eth` is used, the `/about` response is compliant with the [Realm specification (ADR-110)](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-110)

### DAO catalyst resolver

The DAO catalysts are not registered using their friendly name in the [DAO Catalyst Registry](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4a2f10076101650f40342885b99b6b101d83c486) contract, the baseUrl is used instead. To resolve their names, the following algorithm is RECOMMENDED:
1. First the contract needs to be queried to get the list
1. For each catalyst baseUrl, a request needs to be made to their `/about` endpoint
   1. And finally select the matching name
1. If no matching name is selected then return null
