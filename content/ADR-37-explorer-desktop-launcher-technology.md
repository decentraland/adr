## Context and Problem Statement

The Desktop Client Project needs an Application that can easily install and update the Desktop Client.

It must be compatible cross-platform with Windows, macOS and Linux.

The launcher will be the main application that the user will download from the website. So it must be a small size app.

To make this application, the team considered the following options.

## Considered options

### Option A

Use a native app using the Qt library in C++.

#### Advantages

- Using this approach, it will be a speedy app with very low overhead that runs smoothly cross-platform Windows/Mac/Linux
- The Launcher can be used as an Error Catcher

#### Disadvantages

- There are not any projects with this technology at decentraland

### Option B

Update directly from Unity and self-update the client.

#### Advantages

- The app can be deployed as a simple game that can self-updated
- There is no need to maintain two apps (Desktop Client and Desktop Launcher)

#### Disadvantages

- Some technical doubts about whether Unity can be self-updated without major problems.
- Having everything in one app can be a problem. The application has more than one responsibility, and maybe the Desktop Client can interfere with some functionality of the Launcher.
- The Launcher can't be used as an Error catcher because everything is in one app
- The app can be huge in size

### Option C

Create an Electron App with React JS

#### Advantages

- Easy to maintain. There are plenty of react projects in decentraland
- It has a self-update feature integrated
- More features can be added to it, like stats or a section of news and updates.
- The Launcher can be used as an Error Catcher

#### Disadvantages

- The app can be a bit heavy in size

## Decision

The selected option it's option **C**, `Electron App with React JS`. There are many advantages: for example, that the project can be split up into multiple teams. It has the self-update feature integrated so the team can deliver the product faster.
