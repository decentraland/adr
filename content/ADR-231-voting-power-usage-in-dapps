## Abstract

This document outlines the guidelines implemented in Places and Marketplace to use the Voting Power (VP) against abuse. Given that both dApps have use cases where users can vote, rank, or save resources for later use, the Voting Power could help determine the number of reliable users interacting with them.

## Context, Reach & Prioritization

Since interacting with Places or the Marketplace only requires a wallet, by creating multiple accounts, anyone can easily manipulate the number of likes a Place receives or the count of users who add an item to their list. To combat this, users' Voting Power can be utilized to address the problem of account spamming.

Both dApps adopted a similar approach not only to show more accurate and reliable results but also to empower community members and ask them to participate more actively.

On the one hand, Places uses the VP to determine the highest-rated locations. On the other hand, the Marketplace adopts the same technique for counting and showing the number of users who have saved an item in their list.

## Solution Space Exploration

To prevent users from creating multiple accounts to manipulate numbers and metrics in the applications mentioned above, a strategy was put in place to retrieve each user's Voting Power (VP) from the Snapshot platform whenever they perform relevant actions, such as saving an item or liking a place. This information is then stored for future use, and only users with a specific VP, as defined by each dApp, are considered in the final calculation.

To improve performance, the decision was made to store the VP when a user performs an action, rather than retrieving it each time the calculation is requested. This approach is more efficient, as the number of VP calculations increases linearly with the number of users who perform relevant actions.

However, one potential drawback of this method is that users could transfer their assets to a new account and use the same VP they had in their original account to perform actions again in the new one. This could result in inaccurate calculations, as the same assets would be counted twice when retrieving the VP. Additionally, this approach could undervalue new users or those with less Voting Power, as their actions would not be considered in the final count.

## Specification

The guidelines mentioned above were introduced on September 28, 2022 for Places upvotes and downvotes and on May 4, 2023 for the Marketplace Saved Items.
