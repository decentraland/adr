## Abstract

This document outlines the guidelines implemented in the dApps to use the Voting Power (VP) against abuse. Given that some dApps such as Places and the Marketplace have use cases where users can vote, rank, or save resources for later use, the Voting Power could help determine the number of reliable users interacting with them.

## Context, Reach & Prioritization

Since interacting with the dApps only requires a wallet, by creating multiple accounts, anyone can easily manipulate, for example, the number of likes a Place receives or the count of users who add an item to their list. To combat this, users' Voting Power can be utilized to address the problem of account spamming while showing more accurate and reliable results.

For example, Places utilizes the VP system to identify the top-rated locations and the number of times they've been favorited. Likewise, the Marketplace employs the same method to tally and showcase how many users have bookmarked a particular item.

## Solution Space Exploration

To prevent users from creating multiple accounts to manipulate numbers and metrics in the applications mentioned above, a strategy was put in place to retrieve each user's Voting Power (VP) from the Snapshot platform whenever they perform relevant actions, such as saving an item or liking a place. This information is then stored for future use, and only users with a specific VP, as defined by each dApp, are considered in the final calculation.

To improve performance, the decision was made to store the VP when a user performs an action, rather than retrieving it each time the calculation is requested. This approach is more efficient, as the number of VP calculations increases linearly with the number of users who perform relevant actions.

However, one potential drawback of this method is that users could transfer their assets to a new account and use the same VP they had in their original account to perform actions again in the new one. This could result in inaccurate calculations, as the same assets would be counted twice when retrieving the VP. Additionally, this approach could undervalue new users or those with less Voting Power, as their actions would not be considered in the final count.

## Specification

The guidelines mentioned above were introduced on September 28, 2022 for Places upvotes and downvotes and on May 4, 2023 for the Marketplace Saved Items.
