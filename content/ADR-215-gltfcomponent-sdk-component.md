## Component description

<!-- Human readable description of the component, what does it fix and how it affects the entities or the systems from an SDK user point of view -->

The `GltfContainer` component allows to load GLTF models into the scene. The `GltfContainerLoadingState` component allows to track the loading state of the GLTF model.

## Serialization

<!-- Please complete the follwoing table: -->

```yaml
parameters:
  COMPONENT_ID: 1041
  COMPONENT_NAME: core::GltfContainer
  CRDT_TYPE: LastWriteWin-Element-Set
```

```yaml
parameters:
  COMPONENT_ID: 1049
  COMPONENT_NAME: core::GltfContainerLoadingState
  CRDT_TYPE: LastWriteWin-Element-Set
```

<!-- And provide a complete and commented protobuf serialization for the component -->

```protobuf
message PBGltfContainer {
  // the GLTF file path as listed in the deployed entity
  string src = 1;
  
  // default: 0
  optional uint32 visible_meshes_collision_mask = 4;
  
  // default: CL_POINTER | CL_PHYSICS
  optional uint32 invisible_meshes_collision_mask = 5;
}

// GltfContainerLoadingState is set by the engine and provides information about
// the current state of the GltfContainer of an entity.
message PBGltfContainerLoadingState {
  enum LoadingState {
    UNKNOWN = 0;
    LOADING = 1;
    NOT_FOUND = 2;
    FINISHED_WITH_ERROR = 3;
    FINISHED = 4;
  }

  LoadingState current_state = 1;
}
```

# Semantics

## Version of glTF

The only supported version of [glTF is 2.0](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html). The engine MUST NOT support any other version for this component.

## Loading assets

The loading of the glTF will be done by the engine. The `src` property will be used to load the glTF from the deployed entity filesystem ([ADR-80](/adr/ADR-80)).

In the scope of a scene, it is RECOMMENDED that the engine caches the loaded glTF files, so that if the same glTF is used in multiple entities, it is only loaded once. Instancing should be used.

Even though marked as optional by the specification, any protocol that is not `data:` MUST not be supported, i.e. `file://` or `https://`.

The only resolvable assets for the glTF are the ones deployed along with the .gltf/.glb file. Those will be resolved using the same mechanism as the `src` property of the component.

Since `data:` URLs are a bottleneck for parsing resources, it is RECOMMENDED that tooling and engines in "developer mode" warn the scene creators about its performance implications.

### Additional extensions

As per general performance recommendations, every engine and loader SHOULD implement the following extensions:

- [`KHR_materials_basisu`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu/README.md) for texture compression
- KHR_draco_mesh_compression
- EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing
- EXT_meshopt_compression

### Sharing base models with other scenes internally

Due to the fact that the deployments contain hashed assets, it is natural to thing that glTF models inside the engine internally, could be shared across scenes. That is not always true. Here is an example of a scene that uses a glTF model that is not shared with other scenes:

```rust
Scene(Hash="A")
└── "box.gltf"(Hash=0x11111111)
    └── "assets/texture.png"(Hash=0x123123123)

Scene(Hash="B")
└── "box.gltf"(Hash=0x11111111)
    └── "assets/texture.png"(Hash=0xFFFFFFFF)
```

We can clearly see that regardless of the deployed texture, the glTF model remains exactly the same file. This is a common usecase and if caching is applied, the process MUST be aware of all the dependencies of the glTF itself to prevent a vector of attack (poisoning other scene's models with a different texture).

## Animations

### Initial state

All animations in a glTF instance MUST be stopped as the default state when a Animator is present in the entity, so the Animator can manually control the state.

If Animator is not present, only the first animation MUST be played in loop state.

### Controlling animations

Each entity will have its own animation state. The engine MUST provide a way to control the animations of each entity via the Animator component this will be detailed in the ([ADR-216](/adr/ADR-216)).

## Modifying materials of the models

This version of the component does not specify any way to modify the materials of the models. This is a future work.

## Handling visibility & colliders

All meshes belong either to visible or invisible category. Names of invisible meshes should end in `_collider` (case insensitive). Those meshes MUST be invisible and the rest of the properties of the mesh (like its position in an animation) should be honored. This convention is permanent and is not affected by any flag or configuration.

Nodes that are not meshes are also affected by this naming convention. If a node is not a mesh, but it has a direct child that is a mesh, then the mesh MUST be invisible. This behavior only affects the direct children meshes, but not the children of the children and the rest of the descendants.

Collision layers of both visible and invisible meshes are set via `visible_meshes_collision_mask` and `invisible_meshes_collision_mask`. Collision mask set to 0 indicates that collision detection / physics system should ignore meshes of this group, otherwise an engine MUST generate a collider for each mesh of this group and set its collision layers accordingly.

It is RECOMMENDED that an engine implements a way to visualize the colliders for debugging purposes, making these meshes visible with a distinctive material.

By default, collision mask of visible meshes is set to 0, but it could be set, for example, to `CL_POINTER` if it is desirable for pointer meshes to receive pointer events.

It is possible that the value of collision masks is changed at runtime, so the engine SHOULD be able to enable/disable the colliders at runtime.

Skinned meshes are not supported for colliders of any kind.

### Automatic collider based on the model properties

Besides the automatic colliders generated by the engine, it is possible to provide custom colliders with custom masks. This is done by adding a custom property to the glTF file. This is the RECOMMENDED via to provide custom colliders that puts the responsibility of the collider creation in the content creator.

The glTF [extra property](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#reference-extras) named `dcl_collider_mask: uint32` is reserved to the engine and it will be used to generate the collider with the provided mask.

The `dcl_collider_mask` property MUST be a valid `uint32` value. If the value is not valid, the engine MUST ignore it.

The meshes of node names ending in `_collider` MUST _always_ be invisible. This enables both invisible colliders and visible colliders to operate at once.

The extra property `dcl_collider_mask` will be used as `MeshCollider.collider_mask` for each mesh if provided.

## Reporting loading state

For cases depending on the complete loading of an asset like calculating raycasts or colliders, the engine MUST provide a way to report the loading state of the glTF. This is done via the `GltfContainerLoadingState` component. The component provides information about the current state of loading using the following properties:

```protobuf
message PBGltfContainerLoadingState {
  enum LoadingState {
    UNKNOWN = 0;
    LOADING = 1;
    NOT_FOUND = 2;
    FINISHED_WITH_ERROR = 3;
    FINISHED = 4;
  }

  LoadingState current_state = 1;
}
```

Where `UNKNOWN` is the default state, `LOADING` is the state when the glTF is being loaded, `NOT_FOUND` is the state when the glTF is not found, `FINISHED_WITH_ERROR` is the state when the glTF finished loading but with errors and `FINISHED` is the state when the glTF finished loading without errors.

This component also represents the instancing state of the glTF. If the glTF is instanced, the `current_state` will be `FINISHED`. Otherwise, the `current_state` will be `LOADING` until the glTF is instanced correctly.

### Possible errors

The `FINISHED_WITH_ERROR` can be caused by the following errors:

- An asset is not found, including textures, mesh data, etc.
- An extension is not compatible with the engine.
