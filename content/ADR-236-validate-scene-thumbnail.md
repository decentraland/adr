## Context and Problem Statement

Currently, it is possible to add a full URL as a thumbnail in the scene 
display metadata. This `thumbnail` field should only allow referencing a file that is 
part of the scene deployment.

This ADR proposes a new validation to prevent it.

## Proposed solution

Add a validation to be run on scene deployment that forces scenes that have 
a thumbnail to be one of the files embedded in the deployment.
