## Abstract

This document describes the approach used to implement realms modifier. These modifiers allow to modify the state and behaviour of the renderer depending on the realm that has been accessed. This approach allows to easily add or remove functionalities as they are required by the Worlds features.


## Context, Reach & Prioritization

A new Worlds feature is being actively developed. A World is a developer generated realm, in which he/she will be able to take control of different features that had not been possible until now. Also, it allows a sandbox mode which will only run their own scene, giving a boost in performance.

In the first phase of this project, and as the main scope of the MVP, users who got, or just acquire a NAME, will have access to the public beta of Worlds. This will allow them to create a self-contained scene, with limited space and specifications, which can be deployed on catalyst's network content servers, free of charge for the duration of the beta period, not to exceed 12 months.

Discoverability of content will be outside-in, as content creators will be able to share easy to remember URLs to enter the World directly, or inside-out using a join command. Anybody will be able to join a World.


## Solution Space Exploration

To be able to modify the features necessary in each world, we are developing a Realms Plugin which contains Realms Modifiers. Each of this modifiers will have the responsibility to alter DCL functionality by checking if we are entering a user-generated realm or a DAO realm. 

## Specification

### Realms Plugin

The realms plugin is the entry point for the realms modifier. Its is created under the `explorer-realms_modifier_plugin` flag. It's the bridge which receives the 'AboutResponse' sent by kernel and distributes it among all implemented modifiers. By comparing the just accessed realms with the list of available catalysts, it determines if a realm is part of the DAO or a user created world. This variable is necessary for modifiers to execute certain functionaly. On the near future, we could add this bool to the 'AboutResponse' section, so this responsability relies complete on the data and not on a comparison.

### Realms Modifiers Interface

Describes the behaviour necessesary for realms modifiers. Its current implementation requires to specify if we are on a DAO realm; since some behaviour still relies on this property

```
namespace DCLPlugins.RealmsPlugin
{
    public interface IRealmsModifier : IDisposable
    {
        void OnEnteredRealm(bool isCatalyst, AboutResponse realmConfiguration);
    }
}
```

 The current modifiers currently implemented area:

- **Realms Blocker Modifier**

Controls how the green blockers should be shown on each realm. If a realm is a Catalyst, or it has a value on Configurations.CityLoaderContentServer; then the green blockers will be shown.

- **Realms Minimap Modifier**

Controls the functionality associated to the minimap when entering a Realm. It determines if the minimap should be visible using the realmConfiguration.Configurations.Minimap.Enabled value. Also, it determines if the Jump To Home Button should be present. This button will appear on any given user world, and it will take the user back to the home location in the most populated catalyst. 
When needed, this modifier will implement the change of the minimap image; as a user generated world will have the possibility to show its own minimap png.
	

### Data Structure 

`AboutResponse` contains the info of the realm which has just been accessed. This class is autogenerated according to protobuff specifications. Each modifier gets access to the AboutResponse, and gets the info necessary to execute its behaviour. It has the following structure: 

```typescript
type About = {
  healthy: boolean
  configurations: {
    networkId: number
    realmName?: string
    scenesUrn: string[]
    globalScenesUrn: string[]
  }
  content: {
    healthy: boolean
    version?: string
    commitHash?: string
    publicUrl: string
  }
  comms: {
    healthy: boolean
    protocol: string
    fixedAdapter?: string
    usersCount?: number
  }
  lambdas: {
    healthy: boolean
    version?: string
    commitHash?: string
    publicUrl: string
  }
  bff?: {
    healthy: boolean
    userCount: number
    commitHash?: string
    publicUrl: string
  }
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "healthy": true,
  "content": {
    "healthy": true,
    "version": "5.1.2",
    "commitHash": "dce61c002c89db4966c0cdd008d3d654f297050b",
    "publicUrl": "https://peer.decentraland.org/content"
  },
  "configurations": {
    "realmName": "catalyst-4",
    "networkId": 1
  },
  "comms": {
    "healthy": true,
    "protocol": "v3",
    "fixedAdapter": "ws-room:mini-comms.decentraland.org/rooms/test-room"
  },
  "lambdas": {
    "healthy": true,
    "version": "5.1.2",
    "commitHash": "dce61c002c89db4966c0cdd008d3d654f297050b",
    "publicUrl": "https://peer.decentraland.org/lambdas"
  },
  "bff": {
    "healthy": true,
    "commitHash": "369c5dafeda62a1b16f5232cd477565cc3f3d513",
    "userCount": 0,
    "publicUrl": "/"
  }
}
```

## Task breakdown for Explorer

To complete the Beta version for worlds, the following modifiers are required:

- **Skybox Modifier (V1 task):** Create a skybox modifier to allow the world creator control its state.
	- Skybox settings (time and dynamic toggle) will be unavaible while in world; they should be non-interactable.
	- A warning message should be added in settings to explicit to the user that the skybox is being controller by the creator
	- A specific time should be added to the AboutResponse.Configuration to allow the creators set the time of their World
	- Skybox should be set accordingly to the new variable mentioned above

- **Realms Blocker Modifier:** Extra functionality should be added to the current green blockers modifier.
	- Green blockers should appear 2 parcels away from the scene area

- **Loading Screen Modifier (V1 task):** This are required functionalities that should be built on top of the current loading screen when accessing worlds. Requires coordination with the design team.
	- A message of entering world should be added
	- If a world is full (100 users), a warning message should appear (“The world you are trying to access is full. Please try again later”)
	- Add an image url for the loading screen to the AboutResponse json
	- If an image url exists, set it as background

- **Access World Modifier**
	- If user tries to go to an unexistent world, an empty world should be loaded
	- A user should not be able to enter a world if it is full
	- Players should be able to enter a world using /goto world. (Right now we are accessing using changerealm command)

Besides these modifiers, we need to implement the following functionality. 

- **Teleport**
	- All teleports commands (goto random, crowd, coordinates, home) need to verify if we are on a DAO realm and if necessary change to one before completing the command. Its recommended to solve this on kernel directly.
	- The map will show Genesis City. As the teleport commands, we need to check realm before teleporting through the teleport menu and change if necessary.

- **Wizard**
	- As a new player enters DCL, it will be taken to this new tutorial wizard.
	- A world should never trigger the wizard.
	- New users are teleported back to Genesis City after the wizard
	- Remove the current tutorial for new users

## Task breakdown for SDK

This are the tasks that requires collaboration with the SDK team

- The world scene size is limited to 2x2
- Access via decentraland.org/world/NAME
- A world will have a maximum of 100 players connected to it. Reaching the limit will prevent players from entering
- Developers can deploy their Worlds on the Catalysts
- World scenes are up to 15MB*Parcel
