## Abstract

This document outlines the guidelines for counting the number of users who have saved an item in the Marketplace. The approach adopted is similar to the one used in Places for determining the highest-rated percentage of upvotes and downvotes from users with specific Voting Power. However, it has been adapted to meet the needs of the recently launched Marketplace Lists feature.

## Context, Reach & Prioritization

Previously, users of the Decentraland Marketplace needed an option to save items for future reference, leading to missed opportunities for creators and potential customers. The Marketplace Lists feature was introduced to tackle this problem, enabling users to easily create and manage lists of items they plan to save for later and offering a gamified experience.

Defining accuracy as a measure of how many users involved in the project added an item to their list, a Voting Power criterion has been introduced for calculating that number to improve the metric and to empower community members, ensuring a more precise count of saved items.

## Solution Space Exploration

To prevent users from creating different accounts and adding the same item to a list multiple times with them, the strategy employed in Places has been adapted to the new feature requirements. When a new item is added to the list, the user's Voting Power (VP) is retrieved from the Snapshot platform and stored for future use. Then, the number of times an item has been added to a list only considers users with a specific VP.

We chose to store the VP when a user selects an item instead of retrieving the VP each time the saved items count is requested. This approach is more efficient in terms of performance since the number of VP calculations increases linearly with the number of users who have added an item to their list.

One potential drawback of this method, on the one hand, is that users may transfer their assets to a new account and re-add an item to the list with the same Voting Power, as it is only recorded once an item is added. As a result, this could cause the count for that item to be artificially inflated, as the same assets would be counted twice when retrieving the VP, resulting in an inaccurate count. On the other hand, this approach could also lead to undervalue new users or those with less Voting Power who have added an item to their list, as their addition would not be considered in the final count.

## Specification

The guidelines mentioned above were introduced on May 4, 2023.
