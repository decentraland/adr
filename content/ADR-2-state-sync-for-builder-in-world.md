## Context and Problem Statement

We need to find a sustainable path to develop the builder in world without compromising future plans and also enabling experimenting with the static scene definition initiatives and new SDK.

The domain of the problem can be divided in three big chunks:

- State management
- Synchronization
- Behavior

Today we are deciding on the State management.

## Options

### Option 1 - Renderer owns the state

In this approach the owner of the "edited" state is the renderer.

#### Initial load

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant user
  participant kernel
  participant worker
  participant renderer
  participant p2p

  user->>kernel: load scene
  kernel->>worker: create worker
  worker->>worker: load scene
  worker-->>renderer: inform state
```

#### Initial scene loading (while others are editing)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant user
  participant kernel
  participant worker
  participant renderer
  participant p2p


  p2p-->>kernel: edition beacon {scene xy}
  kernel-->>renderer: edition mode
  renderer-->>worker: kill worker

  p2p-->>renderer: process update
  user->>renderer: perform changes (if allowed)
  p2p-->>renderer: process update
```

#### Save state

Save the current snapshot of the static scene

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  user-->>renderer: edition mode
  renderer-->>worker: kill worker
  user->>renderer: perform changes
  renderer->>renderer: process changes ðŸ”§
  user->>renderer: save
  renderer->>kernel: save {serialized state}
  kernel->>builder_server: generate code and store
```

#### Broadcast updates

After a change in state (i.e. builder action)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  user-->>renderer: edition mode
  renderer-->>worker: kill worker
  user->>renderer: perform changes
  user->>renderer:
  user->>renderer:
  renderer->>renderer: process changes ðŸ”§
  renderer-->>p2p: update-msg
```

#### Receive updates

From other connected scenes.

In this case we would receive updates only on edition mode.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  user-->>renderer: enter edition mode
  renderer-->>worker: kill worker
  p2p-->>renderer: update-msg
  renderer->>renderer: process changes ðŸ”§
```

#### Open questions

- Do we want to have a back and forward edition from builder and builder in world?

---

### Option 2 - Scene owns the state

In this approach, the scene code is owner of the state at all times.

#### Initial load

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant user
  participant kernel
  participant worker
  participant renderer
  participant p2p

  user->>kernel: load scene
  kernel->>worker: create worker
  worker->>worker: load scene (JSON)
  worker-->>renderer: inform state

  worker->>worker: connect to synchronization bus
  worker->>kernel: init p2p bus
```

#### Receive updates

From other connected scenes.

In this case we would receive updates either we are editing or not.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant user
  participant kernel
  participant worker
  participant renderer
  participant p2p

  p2p-->>worker: update-msg

  worker->>worker: process changes ðŸ”§
  worker-->>renderer: inform state
```

#### Broadcast updates (v0)

After a change in state (i.e. builder action)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant user
  participant renderer
  participant worker
  participant p2p
  participant kernel


  user->>renderer: perform changes


  renderer-->>p2p: broadcast update-msg
  renderer->>worker: update-msg
  worker->>worker: process changes ðŸ”§
```

#### Broadcast updates (v1)

After a change in state (i.e. builder action)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant user
  participant renderer
  participant worker
  participant p2p
  participant kernel


  user->>renderer: perform changes

  renderer->>worker: update-msg
  worker->>worker: process changes ðŸ”§
  worker-->>p2p: broadcast update-msg
```

#### Save state

Save the current snapshot of the static scene

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant user
  participant renderer
  participant worker
  participant p2p
  participant kernel

  user->>renderer: save state
  renderer->>worker: save

  worker->>worker: serialize scene
  worker->>worker: save JSON (POST?)
```

### Option 3 - new worker owns the state

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  user->>worker: kill worker
  user->>new_worker: create for edition (scene xy)
  new_worker->>content_server: get JSON (scene xy)
  content_server->>new_worker:
  new_worker->>renderer: initial state
  renderer-->>new_worker: update-msg
  renderer-->>p2p: update-msg (for broadcast)
  p2p-->>new_worker: update-msg
```

## Decision Outcome

#### Alternative 1

- Kill worker solution
- We are able to play and stop the scene from the builder in world.
- Requires code generation
- Synchronization is handled by kernel/renderer
- Publish is still an irreversible process

#### Alternative 2

- Keep worker & stop systems
- Delay builder in world until synchronization works (requires work on new SDK)
- We can't go on this alternative until smart items are component based (not code-gen)
- End goal, but it has so much constraints right now

#### Alternative 3 âœ…

- Like alt 1 but creating new worker for syncing instead of using kernel/renderer
- Seems like a nice decoupling of new SDK vs existing/old
- Can work as a foundation for new runtime
