## Decision outcome

### Alt A

#### Pros

- Lower time to market: As long as we can use the current marketplace design with a fewer changes, this alternative has less work for the Dapps team.

- Users are used to performing primary sales in-world (previous license events).

#### Cons

- The content team should create a scene/tutorial about how to perform primary sales of collection v2 items.

### Alt B âœ…

#### Pros

- Users are used to performing in-world primary sales (previous license events).

#### Cons

- Dapps we will need to create a server to connect different sources (subgraphs) to display items from different layers altogether. This server will take ~4 weeks and it has dependencies hard to control and/or estimate. E.g: Thegraph does not support Matic testnet (Mumbai) and we need to host a node graph running it.

- The content team should create a scene/tutorial about how to perform primary sales of collection v2 items.

### Alt C

#### Pros

- No big dependencies from other teams rather than the dApps team.

#### Cons

- High effort and a long time to market.
